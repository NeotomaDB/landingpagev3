In 2007 the database moved to IMEP (Institut Méditerranéen d'Ecologie et de Paléoécologie) in Aix en Provence, which together with Aix-Marseille University fund the current database manager Michelle Leydet. In May 2007 the EPD organized its first open science meeting that lead to a change in governance with currently a chair and vice chair supported by active data stewards. Participants of the 2016 open EPD meeting in Aix en Provence supported the initiative of the EPD to become a constituent database of Neotoma. Data migration was initiated in 2017 and finalized in 2022. The EPD is curated by an active community of data stewards, striving to maintain an open governance structure and fostering exchange of knowledge though open science meetings.</p> <p>See this webpage for further information: https://epdweblog.org/.</p> <p>If using data from the European Pollen Database, please see the preferred citations on the <a href='https://www.neotomadb.org/data/data-use-and-embargo-policy' target='_blank'>Data Use</a> page.<p> <a target='_blank' href='https://apps.neotomadb.org/explorer/?search=%7B%22metadata%22:%7B%22databaseId%22:3%7D%7D'>View EPD sites in Neotoma Explorer.</a>"

During the period between 1998 and 2003, management of the LAPD was based at the University of Amsterdam, where Robert Marchant served as coordinator and additional support was provided by Juan Carlos Berrío. In 2009, the LAPD site inventory was updated again by Suzette Flantua and published in Review of Palaeobotany and Palynology (Flantua et al. 2015 RPP) and made available on the LAPD website. The raw pollen datasets of the LAPD are now in Neotoma as a constituent database.</p> <p>For more information: https://www.latinamericapollendb.com/</p>"

The NAPD was then incorporated into the Global Pollen Database and was served from NOAA's Paleoclimatology World Data Service, before becoming one of the founding constituent databases of Neotoma."

It continued work assembling data that had been ongoing as part of the Diatom Paleoecology Data Cooperative, funded by NOAA and NSF from 1994- 2008. The ANSDU database extends data from sites that were initially in the DPDC, and adds many additional new sites and datasets. It contains primarily diatom count data for lake surface samples and sediment cores. ANSDU data are contained entirely within Neotoma. There is no separate database or website, though there is a directory at Drexel University with contributed data files and supporting materials."

The first curator was Pim (W.O.) van der Knaap. In 1992 the database already covered ca. 30 sites with 50 palynological records. From the beginning, ALPADABA was coordinated with the European Pollen Database (EPD), e.g. in regard to data entry forms and taxonomy. Several taxonomy meetings were organized with EPD to coordinate the typological denominations. The chair of ALPADABA is the head of the palaeoecology section at University of Bern, the curator is appointed among experienced palynologists of the research section. Being in exchange with EPD, ALPADABA served as database for several scientific publications at the Alpine and European scale. In 2020 ALPADABA became a constituent database of Neotoma.

      "dbDescrip": "<p>The APD was first developed in 1996. The initial workshop and subsequent work, funded by the French CNRS, the EU (INCO, ENRICH) and UNESCO (PICG), established methods of collating pollen data, developed a standardized pollen nomenclature (Vincens et al. 2007), generated updated age models, collated images of pollen grains, and created a searchable web interface. Due to a lack of funding and the closure of the French data center, Medias-France, the APD lapsed in 2007, making its extant data holdings largely inaccessible and leaving no home for newer paleoecological records.
